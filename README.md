# RPSLS-Game

RPSLS (or rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock) is a simple and enjoyable game where the user can compete against a computer opponent in a game of chance. 

This site features an adapative layout based on the user's screen size, 2 different game modes which both use a '3 lives' system and a high scores system which the player can set out to achieve and gain bragging rights over their friends!

- __Scores and Lives__

 - This section displays the user's current score count and their 'remaining lives' by changing the visuals after each loss. Once the player has lost a 3rd time, the game is over.

 - This provides the user a sense of achievement with the score counter and adds difficulty by means of limited attempts before the game ends.
